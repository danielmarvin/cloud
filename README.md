### cloud

A POC to show how multiple github.io sites and utilize one azure webapi/sql server/mongodb site. This is the webapi/sqlserver/mongodb project while cloud-one is the vs.net/angularjs site github.io site hitting it. Only sql server so far, will add mongo in the future, but that's no big deal.

The idea is to have the free msdn azure bucks support webapi serivces tied to sql server and free mongolab, then have multiple free github.io angular spas hitting the service. All would be free (with the $200/mo from msdn for azure).
